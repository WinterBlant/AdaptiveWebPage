                <p><q>Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your
                        heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your
                        memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you.
                        Hopefully, you leave something good behind.</q> – Anthony Bourdain</p>

                <p><q>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the
                        ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade
                        winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</q> – Mark Twain</p>

            <div class="text-ww">
                <p><q>If you’re twenty-two, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel – as far
                        and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and
                        eat and cook. Learn from them – wherever you go.</q> – Anthony Bourdain</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-ww">
                <p><q>Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar
                        comfort of home and friends.
                        You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things: air, sleep,
                        dreams, sea, the sky – all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.</q> –
