                <p><q>Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your
                        heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your
                        memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you.
                        Hopefully, you leave something good behind.</q> – Anthony Bourdain</p>

                <p><q>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the
                        ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade
                        winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</q> – Mark Twain</p>

            <div class="text-ww">
                <p><q>If you’re twenty-two, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel – as far
                        and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and
                        eat and cook. Learn from them – wherever you go.</q> – Anthony Bourdain</p>

                <p><q>Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar
                        comfort of home and friends.
                        You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things: air, sleep,
                        dreams, sea, the sky – all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.</q> –

                <h3>The second travel quote by Jennifer Lee is one of my all-time favorite sayings. What I love about it
                    is
                    that it applies to everything- not just travel. It tells you to be bold in pursuing your passions
                    and
                    the things you are interested in. For me, it’s travel. For others, it may be a business venture, a
                    lifestyle change, or even just a big life decision. Whatever you are passionate about, pursue it
                    relentlessly.

                    Traveling for me puts things into perspective. It allows me to realize that there are far bigger
                    things
                    that my problems. So what if the wifi is slow or if my favorite ramen place is closed. Traveling
                    allows
                    you to see that the world is not always about you. It allows me to see how other people live and
                    what
                    they have to deal with on a daily basis.

                    Traveling has humbled me and has broadened my perspective in so many ways. Traveling to places like
                    Southeast Asia and other impoverished areas has given me a sense of gratefulness for the modern day
                    comforts that I am able to enjoy.

                    Coming from the Philippines, saving enough money to be able to do a round the world trip was not
                    easy. I hustled…and I hustled hard. Unlike most first world countries, you can get a part-time job
                    during your university years to help build up your savings. In the Philippines, as minimum wage is
                    low, you virtually have to work multiple jobs in order to make enough to save which is exactly what
                    I did. I was a teacher at that time and worked from 7am-3pm. Afterwards, I would do private
                    tutorials and work for another 4-5 hours.

                <p>
                    At one point, I was earning more from doing extra tutorial work than my job itself. My point behind
                    this is while it
                    seems that all I do now is travel, the quote work, travel, save, repeat is a favorite of mine.
                    Although I no longer work
                    a 9-5 job, we still apply this theory as we save up for specific trips and holidays along the way.

                    I love the quote “The life you have led doesn’t need to be the only life you have.” by Anna Quindlen
                    because I have reinvented myself so many times. Teacher, to a principal, to backpacker, to travel
                    blogger, and full-time digital nomad. As cliche as it sounds, you can be anything you want to be as
                    long as you have the courage to pursue it.
